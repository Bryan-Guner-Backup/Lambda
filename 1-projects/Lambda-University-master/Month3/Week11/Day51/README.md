# [4th Lecture](https://youtu.be/vIa66wXNVOc) w/Thomson Comer: DevOps & Deployment intro
### [@49](https://youtu.be/vIa66wXNVOc?t=49s) WHAT ARE DEVOPS & DEPLOYMENT?
- Deployment: taking your local code and making it available for others to use. E.g.
  1. Deploying to the web
  2. Firmware code for hardware
  3. internally deploying a toolset or library to your team
- Development Operations: goes to the internet and to your customer, DevOps is the part between you and the customer.
  1. Deploying websites in a professional environment on the web
  2. getting your code to server(s) and from server(s) (i.e. the delivery through the internet) to client
  3. INFRASTRUCTURE and how to use it effectively

### [6m40s](https://youtu.be/vIa66wXNVOc?t=6m40s) SIMPLE DEVOPS
[Simple Dev Ops CHART](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/006e89fb-e3fc-43a8-bc62-16e5dc8f7b82?shared=true&)
- Process: (each step involves MILLIONS of lines of code)
1. Configuring a computer (OS, hardware)
2. Connect a computer to the internet (or any network)
3. Configure software to open a socket, listens for and respond to connections (now Your code can run on this machine). Apache/old, now "nginx"
  - nginx does LOAD BALANCING and AUTOMATIC CACHE WEB SERVING
  - accepts multiple connections (usually port 80). nginx handles port80 traffic
  - caching - keeps a list of all files read and a copy of files
  - nginx connects to the internet
4. Your code involves customization, satisfies a specific task, business, hobby, etc.
5. make software "FAILURE TOLERANT" e.g. automatic restarting (don't want to crash and _stay_ crashed)
6. Make software DATA CONSISTENT(e.g. how to deal with simultaneous data submissions)

### [@18m30s](https://youtu.be/vIa66wXNVOc?=18m30s) "That's 'Simple' DevOps"
- usenet (thank you DARPA)
> "One of these was in someone's basement and it had a wire connected to it."

### [@21m30s](https://youtu.be/vIa66wXNVOc?t=21m30s) "Things are more complicated now"
- IP Addresses
- Router
- icann: int'l corp for assigned names and numbers
- Domain name purchasing (e.g. namecheap, godaddy)
- DNS
- whois guarding
- https the "s" is Security TLS transport Level Security, uses port 443 instead of 80.
- certificates
- digicert.com SSL & PKI (public/private key pair)
- self sign certificates
