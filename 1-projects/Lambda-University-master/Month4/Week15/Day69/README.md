# [4th Lecture](https://youtu.be/V6MaRvOikUE) w/Sean Chen: LS-Operating Systems, Processes Mini
- https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Processes
- what are processes? (from LS-OS1: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-intro.pdf)
- an abstraction to describe any running system on the computer
  - Process: Code, Stack, Heap (optional), program counter
- processes are isolated, each has access to its own chunk of memory
- state of process state is saved, next process gets execution privileges on the cpu
- pre-empting the process: stopping the active process and saving its state
- context switch
