everyone in this video we're gonna\n\nbe talking about size units in CSS and\n\nreally giving into some more responsive\n\nunits so the first unit we're gonna talk\n\nabout today is a pixel so if you see my\n\nscreen here a pixel is something that\n\nwe've been using this entire time\n\nalright we say you know width of 800\n\npixels and you're like well what is a\n\npixel well if you look at my screen here\n\nyou can see defined one pixel you know\n\nit's right there let me zoom it as much\n\nas I can so that's gonna be considered\n\none pixel so when we talk about pixels\n\nthat's what we mean is that one little\n\nunit and it's different on every size\n\nscreen especially with the Retina\n\ndisplays and the high definition\n\ndisplays or we get a lot more pixels\n\ninto one size screen so pixels can mean\n\ndifferent things on different sized\n\nscreens but that's what a pixel is right\n\nthere so in this video we're going to\n\ntalk mostly about text but we'll get\n\ninto some other stuff too so see the\n\npixels so pixels are referred to as an\n\nabsolute length unit it means that\n\npixels are set in stone\n\nthey don't adjust for anything pixels\n\nare it's going to be the same size no\n\nmatter what size screen you have so if\n\nwe come in and say something like let's\n\nopen this up alright now I've got a CSS\n\nreset on this so you're gonna see some\n\nstuff I'm gonna get that out of the way\n\nso we get a little bit more so it looks\n\na little bit different so our our\n\nbrowsers most of the time and we can\n\nactually change this and we'll talk\n\nabout in the next video most of the time\n\nour browsers are set by default to 16\n\npixel text\n\nokay so 16 pixels is kind of the\n\nstandard size for text and that's what\n\nthese H ones are of course I have a\n\nreset so all of the browser's specific\n\nstylings on the h1 have been removed but\n\nthat is 16 pixels right there so let's\n\ncome in here and we are going to talk\n\nabout font size right now size and let's\n\nchange this to 20 pixels one thing\n\nyou'll notice is that font size cascades\n\nall the way through right so we have\n\nsome children of children in here we\n\nhave some H ones nested deep in here and\n\nthey all change size right let's change\n\nit even bigger and let's say 40 pixels\n\nso pixels are really simple to use\n\nright they have a set size we know\n\nexactly what size they are unfortunately\n\nthey're not really responsive and\n\nresponsive and an accessibility way\n\nespecially when we talk about fonts you\n\nknow that's why we don't want to set our\n\nwidth of our containers to be this\n\nhard-coded pixel which we learned about\n\nin the last lesson we we want to have it\n\na little bit more fluid you know we\n\ntalked about the difference between the\n\ndifferent layouts we have but we know\n\nwhat a pixel is right and so it's really\n\neasier easy for developers to read from\n\ndesign files using pixels in the past we\n\nweren't able to do something like this\n\nand get something to grow you know we\n\ncan we can you know on the Mac its\n\ncommand + and we can get our fonts to\n\ngrow but now we can and so it does grow\n\nnow with zoom features and like I said\n\nwe we get it goes all the way through\n\nright it cascades down and it effects\n\nevery level on here so we can set pixel\n\nsize on our main content here and it'll\n\ncascade all the way through the\n\nunfortunate thing is pixels aren't\n\nresponsive they're hard-coded font size\n\nvalues are not accessible and they just\n\nthis rigid rigid thing so to make up for\n\nthat we have well not we I didn't but a\n\ndeveloper community has adopted\n\nsomething called\n\nem so an M is referred to as a relative\n\nlength unit\n\nit means Em's adjust to their\n\nsurroundings so an M is going to take\n\nthe the font size of its parent and it's\n\ngonna create something relative to that\n\nso if I say font size of 40 pixels on\n\nmain content here if I go inner content\n\nand I can say font size of let's say if\n\nI say 1 M we're not going to see\n\nanything changed because 1 M is going to\n\nbe one of that 40 so whatever its parent\n\nis it's gonna take that whole thing so\n\nif I wanted to this to be 20 how many MS\n\nwould I put in there if you said 0.5\n\nthat's correct\n\nall right so now I've got these that are\n\n20 okay if I came down into the third\n\ncontainer and I wanted to make this 5\n\nwhat would I need to put in here so\n\nlet's think about this we've got a 40\n\npixel container a 20 pixel inner\n\ncontainer and we want to have this to be\n\n5 so we'd put 0.25 ms a much to smaller\n\nread for anyone but you get the picture\n\nso we can use these M's to set our you\n\nknow main font size and then use them to\n\nadjust based on that font size right so\n\nif you think about it let's let's\n\nactually do this let's bring that back\n\nup to 40 so if I wanted to do 40 again I\n\nwould do to em right because we for T we\n\ntake it down to 20 and we want to bring\n\nit back up to 40 if I wanted to be 63 M\n\nright so the big thing about ms are they\n\nare responsive to\n\ntheir surroundings okay so we can make\n\nthese a responsive unit I would say the\n\nbiggest downsides to em is the math you\n\nhave to do all right you have to know\n\nwhat size unit the parent container is\n\nand then you write we were like okay if\n\nwe want this to be 60 and this is you\n\nknow 20 but what if this was like 16 or\n\nsomething what if we had our main font\n\nsize was 16 and then if we want it to be\n\n20 like oh I gotta get my calculator out\n\nnow and it's like 1.3 or something to\n\nthat effect you know and then yeah that\n\nlooks somewhat right but you know it's\n\njust this this problem where we've got\n\nthis cascading effect and we have to\n\nalways know what the parent m is at it's\n\nreally good not m's work really well\n\nplenty of professional development\n\noffices and teams use Em's as they're\n\nresponsive size but we've come up with\n\nsomething better and well that's my\n\npersonal opinion but there is there is\n\nsomething else out there for phones and\n\nthat is known as the REM so a REM is a\n\nroot em so a root M is always gonna be\n\nrelative to the root element so it's\n\ngonna look at the root element on the\n\npage and it's usually gonna be the HTML\n\ntag so if we come up we can see we have\n\nan HTML tag up here and let's just for\n\nthe heck of it set our font size to 10\n\npixels and our HTML pixels all right so\n\nour whole page font size is 10 pixels\n\nright and so remember that font size is\n\none of those CSS properties that\n\ncascades through our entire page so if\n\nwe don't specifically explicitly change\n\nit then it'll stay at 10 pixels\n\nthroughout our entire page so let's come\n\nin here and our main content let's say\n\nthat we want to use a red okay remember\n\nthis is a root element\n\nit works just like an M in that the\n\nnumber here is going to be the the the\n\namount of that element we want to use\n\nright so if we wanted our root element\n\nto be 20 we would use 20 rep okay so\n\nthat's cool\n\nlet me read these but where it really\n\nshines is this we've got 20 M's right\n\nhere 20 REMS excuse me or 20 pixels\n\nbecause it's two REMS and so all of our\n\nelements are 20 pixels now what if we\n\ncame down into here and said we wanted\n\nthis to be 27 pixels right if that was\n\nan M we would need to figure out 27\n\ndivided or 28 divided by 27 or 27\n\ndivided by 20 what's the you know\n\nprobably one point two eight something\n\nlike that with rims though we can just\n\nsay 2.7 for M and we get 27 all right\n\nthat's with at ten pixels here so\n\nremember that our font size normally for\n\nour screening is 16 pixels we're gonna\n\nshow you a cool little trick in just a\n\nminute and then our third container and\n\nsay we wanted this to be like 14 right\n\nwe could easily just say one point for M\n\nand it would bring it to 14 and just to\n\nprove that let's open up our dev tools\n\nhover over it and you can see font is 20\n\npixels on that one\n\nfont is 27 pixels on that one font is 14\n\npixels on that one so that's working\n\nwell for us all right so it's it's\n\ntaking that root element not the parent\n\nelement so we can have something nested\n\nsuper deep and still understand that\n\nthis is gonna be a this is going to be\n\nin conjunction with that root element\n\nnot the parent so that's a rim rims are\n\nreally cool they work really well you\n\nknow exactly exactly\n\nwhat\n\nwhat font size you're gonna get\n\nespecially if you use something like\n\nfont size of 10 all right so we're gonna\n\nuse font size of 10 just as our base\n\nfont and then going all the way through\n\nif we didn't have this up here remember\n\nwhat I said that our our font size tends\n\nto be 16 makes rim's a little bit more\n\ndifficult to deal with just because we\n\nhave to figure out what you know 16 what\n\npercentage of 16 we want all right so if\n\nwe said it to 10 we know exactly what\n\nthat is that that's 10 and we can just\n\nsay 2.7 and that's going to be equal to\n\n27 pixels all right and 2 is going to be\n\nequal to 20 pixels so we can see if we\n\nget design files we can we can check out\n\nwhat size font they want and it's\n\nusually in pixels on a design file and\n\nthen we can just set it using REMS so\n\nthe pros are it's responsive to the root\n\nelement we don't have to do all this\n\nmath we don't have to keep track of what\n\nthe parents are any of that stuff and\n\nwe're gonna talk about percentages in\n\njust a minute when we get to our\n\naccessibility stuff but they are we can\n\ndo this to like be really easy to create\n\nour fonts the cons are if we don't set\n\nour font size in the HTML we don't\n\nreally know what it is we think it's\n\ngonna be 16 but in the next video you'll\n\nsee it could be a lot of things so we\n\ndon't really know what it is but we have\n\nto set it in the HTML and converting\n\npixels terms if we don't know what it is\n\nit can be cumbersome but we have steps\n\nthat we take to get over these things a\n\ncouple of other units I want to talk\n\nabout are percentages and view width and\n\nview height so percentages we've been\n\nusing a percentage base right\n\npercentages are based on the apparent\n\nwidth so it doesn't really work super\n\nwell for for fonts but let's go man\n\nappear into our container and let's give\n\nthis a border to pics a little solid\n\nblack let's see it\n\nso we've been talking about it you know\n\nso what's the parent width of or what's\n\nthe parent of container it's our whole\n\npage so when we take a percentage of\n\nso if we say 75% instead of 800 pixels\n\nwe're gonna take 75% of the entire\n\ncontainer right if we did something\n\ninside of main content here what if I\n\nsaid not mein kampf yeah yeah in\n\nconfidence fine I'm gonna go border to\n\nbigs little green and if I said with 75%\n\nin here we have to understand and that's\n\ngonna be 75% of the container that it's\n\nin so that's gonna be the container\n\nright so so we have to know when we use\n\npercentages where the item is and what\n\nkind of context it's in because it's\n\nonly going to affect the context based\n\non that container size around it so\n\nthat's a percentage we use percentages\n\nreally a lot for responsive layout but\n\nreally with our max width right we want\n\nto be fluid in between those sizes but\n\nwe want to snap to those max widths so\n\nthat's the best way to use percentages\n\non here so responsiveness starts at the\n\nviewport level and cascades down\n\ndepending on what container we're in or\n\nthe parent element that it's in and\n\nwhit's can get really small really fast\n\nright so if I open my dev tools up again\n\n75% of something seems like a lot but\n\nwhen you get down to something small\n\nthen it becomes very small so we have to\n\nbe careful with percentages and that's\n\nwhy it's always advisable to use them\n\nwith a static width\n\nas more max-width one last item I want\n\nto talk about is view width and view\n\nheight so if we come up into container\n\nand I'm gonna say you with this V W and\n\nso if I say one feet up you go 100 there\n\nwe go it's a direct percentage of our\n\narea around it so this is gonna be\n\ndifferent than a percent because I can\n\ncome into any element in here and if I\n\nsay width of 100 V W that's going to\n\nmake that element to the viewport size\n\nscreen it's not it transcends its parent\n\nit goes beyond to the viewport size\n\nscreen so caution against using them at\n\nthis point in learning they do come in\n\nhandy when we need to do full screen\n\nlayouts and things like that but you\n\nreally have to understand that they are\n\ngoing to adhere to the size of the\n\nscreen and not to anything going on on\n\nthe page okay so if we did ten view it\n\nwe're gonna get 10% of the screen size\n\nnot the parent which it is 10% of the\n\nparent now let's do 75 all right so\n\nthat's 10% of the screen size not the\n\nparent so if we do 100 on that again\n\nshould break out of it see so there we\n\ngo we have the 100% of the screen size\n\nthat's the issue with view with view\n\nheight is the same thing so that's BH so\n\nif I say 100% of the height the height\n\nof the screen isn't very very big but\n\nyeah that's that's what it is okay\n\nthere's a bunch of other units out there\n\nthese are by far the most common and the\n\nmost popular you'll see Ram's M's pixels\n\n% view within view height that's it\n\nthere's points there's a lot of other\n\nthings out there\n\nuse but not really popular to see used\n\nin modern web development so that's a\n\nquick introduction to our unit sizes and\n\nI'll see you in the next
