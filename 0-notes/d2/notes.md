Ice Breaker - 10 things in common
In this icebreaker exercise, your team needs to find 10 quality things you all have in common. (Ask one student from the team to be the notetaker, create a google doc, and share the list with everyone in the channel)
Technical Stand-Up as a Team (15-20 min):
Everyone share 1 blocker, 1 win, and 1 thing they need help with or could give help with - if people need help, you all can use some of your meeting time for that as well.
Starting the Conversation for Team Norms (15-20 min):
We also want you all to start thinking about and talking through as a team on your individual work styles, while setting team norms:
